| Host | Role | Private FQDN | Private IP Address |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|ns1|	Primary DNS Server|	ns1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.10.11|
|ns2|	Secondary DNS Server|	ns2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.20.12|
|host1|	Generic Host 1|	host1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.100.101|
|host2|	Generic Host 2|	host2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.200.102|

## Step 4 — Configuring DNS Clients

Before all of your servers in the `trusted` ACL can query your DNS servers, you must configure each of them to use **ns1** and **ns2** as name servers.

Assuming your client servers are running Ubuntu, you’ll need to find what device is associated with your private network. You can do this by querying the private subnet with the `ip address` command. Run the following command **on each of your client machines**, replacing the highlighted subnet with your own:
```
ip address show to 10.128.0.0/16
```
>*Output*
```console
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    altname enp0s4
    altname ens4
    inet 10.128.100.101/16 brd 10.128.255.255 scope global eth1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
In this example, the private interface is `eth1`. The examples throughout this section will refer to `eth1` as the private interface, but you should change these examples to reflect your own servers’ private interfaces.

On Ubuntu 22.04, networking is configured with Netplan, an abstraction that allows you to write standardized network configuration and apply it to compatible backend networking software. To configure DNS, you need to write a Netplan configuration file.

Create a new file in `/etc/netplan` called `00-private-nameservers.yaml`:
```
sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-private-nameservers.yaml
```
Inside, add the following contents. You will need to modify the interface of the private network, the addresses of your **ns1** and **ns2** DNS servers, and the DNS zone:

>>*Note: Netplan uses the [YAML data serialization](http://yaml.org/) format for its configuration files. Because YAML uses indentation and whitespace to define its data structure, make sure that your definition uses consistent indentation to avoid errors.*
>>
>>*You can troubleshoot your YAML file using a YAML checker like [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/).*

>/etc/netplan 00-private-nameservers.yaml
```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth1:                                    # Private network interface
            nameservers:
                addresses:
                - 10.128.10.11                # Private IP for ns1
                - 10.132.20.12                # Private IP for ns2
                search: [ nyc3.example.com ]    # DNS zone

```
Save and close the file when you are finished.

Next, tell Netplan to attempt to use the new configuration file by using `netplan try`. If there are problems that cause a loss of networking, Netplan will automatically roll back the changes after a timeout:
```
sudo netplan try
```
>*Output*
```console
Warning: Stopping systemd-networkd.service, but it can still be activated by:
  systemd-networkd.socket
Do you want to keep these settings?


Press ENTER before the timeout to accept the new configuration


Changes will revert in 120 seconds
```
If the countdown is updating correctly at the bottom, the new configuration is at least functional enough to not break your SSH connection. Press `ENTER` to accept the new configuration.

Now, check that the system’s DNS resolver to determine if your DNS configuration has been applied:
```
sudo resolvectl status
```

Scroll down until you find the section for your private network interface. The private IP addresses for your DNS servers should be listed first, followed by some fallback values. Your domain should be listed after `DNS Domain`:

>*Output*
```console
Link 3 (eth1)
    Current Scopes: DNS
         Protocols: +DefaultRoute +LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
Current DNS Server: 67.207.67.3
       DNS Servers: 10.128.10.11 10.128.20.12 67.207.67.3 67.207.67.2
        DNS Domain: nyc3.example.com
```
Your Ubuntu client is now configured to use your internal DNS servers.
