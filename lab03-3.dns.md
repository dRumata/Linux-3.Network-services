| Host | Role | Private FQDN | Private IP Address |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|ns1|	Primary DNS Server|	ns1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.10.11|
|ns2|	Secondary DNS Server|	ns2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.20.12|
|host1|	Generic Host 1|	host1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.100.101|
|host2|	Generic Host 2|	host2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.200.102|

## Step 3 — Configuring the Secondary DNS Server

In most environments, it is a good idea to set up a secondary DNS server that will respond to requests if the primary becomes unavailable. Luckily, configuring the secondary DNS server is much less complicated than setting up the primary.

On **ns2**, edit the `named.conf.options` file:
```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.options
```
At the top of the file, add the ACL with the private IP addresses of all of your trusted servers:

>/etc/bind/named.conf.options — updated 1 of 2 (secondary)
```c
acl "trusted" {
        10.128.10.11;   # ns1
        10.128.20.12;   # ns2 
        10.128.100.101;  # host1
        10.128.200.102;  # host2
};

options {

        . . .
```
Below the `directory` directive, add the following lines:

>/etc/bind/named.conf.options — updated 2 of 2 (secondary)
```c
    . . .

        recursion yes;
        allow-recursion { trusted; };
        listen-on { 10.128.20.12; };      # ns2 private IP address
        allow-transfer { none; };          # disable zone transfers by default

        forwarders {
                8.8.8.8;
                8.8.4.4;
        };

    . . .
```
Save and close the `named.conf.options` file. This file should be identical to ns1’s `named.conf.options` file except it should be configured to listen on ns2’s private IP address.

Now edit the `named.conf.local` file:
```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```
Define secondary zones that correspond to the primary zones on the primary DNS server. Note that the type is `secondary`, the file does not contain a path, and there is a `primaries` directive which should be set to the primary DNS server’s private IP address. If you defined multiple reverse zones in the primary DNS server, make sure to add them all here:

>/etc/bind/named.conf.local — updated (secondary)
```c
zone "nyc3.example.com" {
    type secondary;
    file "db.nyc3.example.com";
    primaries { 10.128.10.11; };  # ns1 private IP
};

zone "128.10.in-addr.arpa" {
    type secondary;
    file "db.10.128";
    primaries { 10.128.10.11; };  # ns1 private IP
};
```
Now save and close the `named.conf.local` file.

Run the following command to check the validity of your configuration files:
```
sudo named-checkconf
```
If this command doesn’t return any errors, restart BIND:
```
sudo systemctl restart bind9
```
Then allow DNS connections to the server by altering the UFW firewall rules:
```
sudo ufw allow Bind9
```
With that, you now have primary and secondary DNS servers for private network name and IP address resolution. Now you must configure your client servers to use your private DNS servers.
