| Host | Role | Private FQDN | Private IP Address |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|ns1|	Primary DNS Server|	ns1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.10.11|
|ns2|	Secondary DNS Server|	ns2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.20.12|
|host1|	Generic Host 1|	host1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.100.101|
|host2|	Generic Host 2|	host2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.200.102|

## Step 6 — Maintaining DNS Records

Now that you have a working internal DNS, you need to maintain your DNS records so they accurately reflect your server environment.

**Adding a Host to DNS**

Whenever you add a host to your environment (in the same datacenter), you will want to add it to DNS. Here is a list of steps that you need to take:

**Primary Name Server**

- Forward zone file: Add an `A` record for the new host, increment the value of `Serial`
- Reverse zone file: Add a `PTR` record for the new host, increment the value of `Serial`
- Add your new host’s private IP address to the `trusted` ACL (`named.conf.options`)

Test your configuration files:
```
sudo named-checkconf
sudo named-checkzone nyc3.example.com /etc/bind/zones/db.nyc3.example.com
sudo named-checkzone 128.10.in-addr.arpa /etc/bind/zones/db.10.128
```
Then reload BIND:
```
sudo systemctl reload bind9
```
Your primary server should be configured for the new host now.

**Secondary Name Server**

- Add your new host’s private IP address to the `trusted` ACL (`named.conf.options`)

Check the configuration syntax:
```
sudo named-checkconf
```
Then reload BIND:
```
sudo systemctl reload bind9
```
Your secondary server will now accept connections from the new host.

**Configure New Host to Use Your DNS**

- Configure /etc/resolv.conf to use your DNS servers
- Test using nslookup

**Removing a Host from DNS**

If you remove a host from your environment or want to just take it out of DNS, just remove all the things that were added when you added the server to DNS (i.e. the reverse of the previous steps).
