| Host | Role | Private FQDN | Private IP Address |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|ns1|	Primary DNS Server|	ns1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.10.11|
|ns2|	Secondary DNS Server|	ns2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.20.12|
|host1|	Generic Host 1|	host1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.100.101|
|host2|	Generic Host 2|	host2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.200.102|

## Step 5 — Testing Clients

Use `nslookup` to test if your clients can query your name servers. You should be able to do this on all of the clients that you have configured and are in the `trusted` ACL.

You can start by performing a forward lookup.

**Forward Lookup**

To perform a forward lookup to retrieve the IP address of `host1.nyc3.example.com`, run the following command:
```
nslookup host1
```
Querying `host1` expands to `host1.nyc3.example.com` because the `search` option is set to your private subdomain, and DNS queries will attempt to look on that subdomain before looking for the host elsewhere. The previous command will return output like the following:

>Output
```console
Server:     127.0.0.53
Address:    127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   host1.nyc3.example.com
Address: 10.128.100.101
```
Next, you can check reverse lookups.

**Reverse Lookup**

To test the reverse lookup, query the DNS server with **host1**’s private IP address:
```
nslookup 10.128.100.101
```
This should return output like the following:

>Output
```console
11.10.128.10.in-addr.arpa   name = host1.nyc3.example.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

If all of the names and IP addresses resolve to the correct values, that means that your zone files are configured properly. If you receive unexpected values, be sure to review the zone files on your primary DNS server (e.g. `db.nyc3.example.com` and `db.10.128`).

As a final step, this tutorial will go over how you can maintain your zone records.
