## Example Infrastructure and Goals

For the purposes of this article, we will assume the following:

- You have two servers which will be designated as your DNS name servers. This guide will refer to these as ns1 and ns2.
- You have two additional client servers that will be using the DNS infrastructure you create, referred to as host1 and host2 in this guide. You can add as many client servers as you’d like.
- All of these servers exist in the same datacenter. This tutorial assumes that this datacenter is called nyc3.
- All of these servers have private networking enabled and are on the 10.128.0.0/16 subnet (you will likely have to adjust this for your servers).
- All servers are connected to a project that runs on example.com. This guide outlines how to set up an internal, private DNS system, so you can use any domain name you’d like instead of example.com. The DNS servers will always attempt to first route requests internally, meaning they won’t try to reach the given domain on the public internet. However, using a domain you own may help avoid conflicts with publicly routable domains.

With these assumptions in mind, the examples in this guide will use a naming scheme based around the subdomain nyc3.example.com to refer to the example private subnet or zone. Therefore, host1’s private Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) will be host1.nyc3.example.com. The following table holds the relevant details used in examples throughout this guide:

| Host | Role | Private FQDN | Private IP Address |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|ns1|	Primary DNS Server|	ns1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.10.11|
|ns2|	Secondary DNS Server|	ns2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.20.12|
|host1|	Generic Host 1|	host1.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.100.101|
|host2|	Generic Host 2|	host2.nyc3.example.com|	10.128.200.102|

## Step 1 — Installing BIND on DNS Servers
On both DNS servers, ns1 and ns2, update the apt package cache by typing:
```
sudo apt update
```
Then install BIND on each machine:
```
sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc
```
set BIND to IPv4 mode. On both servers, edit the named default settings file using your preferred text editor. The following example uses nano:
```
sudo nano /etc/default/named
```
Add -4 to the end of the OPTIONS parameter:
> . . .
> OPTIONS="-u bind -4"

Save and close the file when you are finished. If you used nano to edit the file, you can do so by pressing CTRL + X, Y, then ENTER.

Restart BIND to implement the changes:
```
sudo systemctl restart bind9
```
